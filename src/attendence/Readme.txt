we cannot take attendence of a student who is not register for the class
so first we have to check if a student is registered for the class or not
I used realpath AttendenceSheet.txt in commandline to get the path of the text 
file where I wanted to save all the students, after going inside the file
by doing cd Desktop then I went inside the AttendenceSheet.txt and typed realpath
and the file name

we need to create separate file for each student and we will save the name of 
the file with the student's first name
